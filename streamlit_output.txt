--Comment--
COO is an asshole and dumb ass. I hate coming to work because of her.
--Reply--
You should not use profanities like 'ass, asshole' because it is unprofessional and hurtful. Personality attacking like calling them, or even yourself, 'hate, dumb' is damaging to the esteem of the recipient, instead focus on calling out behaviours. Looks like your language level is a little too simplistic, consider writing more comprehensive comment rather than short ones. Use the situation-behaviour-impact as a guide. Hm... there appears to be no work related skills or work actions mentioned, please consider appropriateness of your feedback in workplace setting only and provide specific work behaviours examples to give context.
--Comment--
My manager is a bit too emotional. She is a stupid bitch. She should keep her mouth shut.
--Reply--
You should not use profanities like 'bitch' because it is unprofessional and hurtful. Avoid judgemental words like 'should' because this tends to put recipient in defensive mode. Personality attacking like calling them, or even yourself, 'emotional, stupid, bitch' is damaging to the esteem of the recipient, instead focus on calling out behaviours. The overall comment has very negative sentiment, please consider using the sandwich approach to highlight positive behaviours before giving negative criticism followed by positive suggestions.

My manager is an real idiot, likes to micromanage me and tell me what to do as if as I am dumb. I lose interest in putting best effort in work because of him.

Cannot do anything right, I kept asking her to change the report but she did not. She kept complaining things are not working but I don't see her making any efforts to correct them. I don't know how to help her anymore.

Fourier based methods such as the Lombâ€“Scargle periodogram [35], the fast Fourier transform-nonlinear least squares (FFT-NLLS) algorithm [36], harmonic regression [37] and the spectrum resampling method [38] can be used to extract further parameters, namely acrophase, amplitude and period, that are typically of interest to studies of circadian rhythmicity.

The federal industrial laws about workplace agreements have changed a number of times in recent years. Before the WorkChoices laws came into effect in March 2006, workplace agreements were called Certified Agreements (agreements between an employer and a group of employees) and Australian Workplace Agreements or AWAs (agreements between an employer and an individual employee).
